  truths:
    - User sees "Turn your Figma into a working prototype" and "Connect with Figma" CTA
    - User can paste Figma frame URL in input and click Import
    - If user pastes URL before connecting, sees "Connect with Figma to import this frame."

<objective>
Landing view and Paste URL view in Build main area. Connect with Figma CTA, paste URL input, Import button. Connect-vs-paste logic: if URL pasted before OAuth, show "Connect with Figma to import this frame."

Purpose: User can discover Connect CTA and paste URL flow. Connect gate enforced per user decision.
Output: BuildLanding.tsx, PasteUrlView.tsx, state-driven main area content.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Landing view with Connect CTA</name>
  <files>frontend/app/components/BuildLanding.tsx, frontend/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create BuildLanding.tsx. Content from designs/screen-01.html: h1 "Turn your Figma into a working prototype", p "Import a frame, describe what you want in chat, get live Prototype.", button "Connect with Figma" (bg-primary, hover:bg-primary-dark). "How it works" link (deferred — can be # or placeholder). Export onConnectClick prop — parent will wire to OAuth in 01-05. Render BuildLanding in page.tsx main area when no URL pasted and not in paste flow. Use design tokens (primary, sand-light, charcoal, etc.).
  </action>
  <verify>Visit / — see "Turn your Figma into a working prototype" and "Connect with Figma" button.</verify>
  <done>Landing view renders with Connect CTA. onConnectClick callback ready for wiring.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Paste URL view and Connect-vs-paste logic</name>
  <files>frontend/app/components/PasteUrlView.tsx, frontend/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create PasteUrlView.tsx from designs/screen-02.html: label "Figma frame URL", input placeholder "https://figma.com/design/...", Import button. "Need help? Learn how to find your frame URL" link. Export props: figmaUrl, onUrlChange, onImportClick, figmaConnected (boolean). If figmaConnected is false and user has pasted URL: show message "Connect with Figma to import this frame." above or near Import button; Import disabled or triggers Connect. If figmaConnected is true: Import enabled, calls onImportClick. Page state: figmaUrl, figmaConnected (from 01-05 — can be false initially), view mode (landing | paste). Add way to switch to paste view (e.g. "Paste frame URL" link on landing, or show paste when URL is entered). Per user decision: paste first → show Connect prompt; Connect must complete before import.
  </action>
  <verify>Paste URL, click Import without connecting — see "Connect with Figma to import this frame." With figmaConnected=true (mock), Import triggers onImportClick.</verify>
  <done>Paste URL view works. Connect gate enforced when URL pasted before OAuth.</done>
</task>
