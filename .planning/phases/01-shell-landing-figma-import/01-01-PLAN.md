must_haves:
  truths:
    - User lands at / and sees Build shell with tabs
    - User sees Research | Blueprint | Build tabs; Build is active
    - Main area is ~65%, sidebar is ~35% (Cursor-like layout)
    - Research tab navigates to /research
    - Existing research flows work at /research, /research/explore, /research/dashboard
  artifacts:
    - path: frontend/app/page.tsx
      provides: Build shell at /
      contains: "Build"
    - path: frontend/app/research/page.tsx
      provides: Research landing (moved from current page.tsx)
      contains: "What would you like to build"
    - path: frontend/app/globals.css
      provides: Design tokens for shell (sand-light, stone, charcoal-light if missing)
  key_links:
    - from: frontend/app/page.tsx
      to: frontend/app/research/page.tsx
      via: Link or router to /research
      pattern: "href=.*research|/research"

<objective>
Route restructure: Build shell at /, Research tool at /research. Create Cursor-like layout (main 65%, sidebar 35%) with tabs per designs.

Purpose: Make prototype the default experience; research stays accessible. Layout matches designs/screen-01.html through screen-04.html.
Output: Build shell page at /, research routes under /research, tab navigation.

  <name>Task 1: Move research routes to /research</name>
  <files>frontend/app/research/page.tsx, frontend/app/research/layout.tsx, frontend/app/research/explore/[journeyId]/page.tsx, frontend/app/research/dashboard/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create frontend/app/research/ directory. Move current page.tsx content (LandingPage with "What would you like to build?", pills, RUN) to research/page.tsx. Move explore/[journeyId]/page.tsx to research/explore/[journeyId]/page.tsx. Move dashboard/page.tsx to research/dashboard/page.tsx. Create research/layout.tsx if needed for shared research layout (minimal — can be empty or pass-through). Update all internal links: /explore/new → /research/explore/new, /explore/[id] → /research/explore/[id], /dashboard → /research/dashboard. Update router.push and href in research components. Do NOT change research page content — only relocate.
  </action>
  <verify>Visit /research — see research landing. Visit /research/explore/new — navigates. Visit /research/dashboard — see dashboard. No 404s.</verify>
  <done>Research tool fully functional at /research/*. Old /explore and /dashboard paths removed or redirected.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Build shell at / with tabs and layout</name>
  <files>frontend/app/page.tsx, frontend/app/globals.css</files>
  <action>
    Replace frontend/app/page.tsx with Build shell. Structure from designs/screen-01.html: flex container with main (flex-1, ~65%) + aside (w-[35%], min-w-[400px], max-w-[550px]). Main: white bg, rounded-3xl, border, shadow. Aside: sand-dark bg (#F2EFE9), rounded-2xl, border. Add design tokens to globals.css if missing: sand-light (#F9F7F2), sand-dark (#F2EFE9), stone (#E6E2DC), charcoal-light (#78726D) — map to Tailwind v4 @theme or extend existing. Header in main: tabs Research | Blueprint | Build. Build tab active (italic, underline). Research tab links to /research. Blueprint tab can link to /research or placeholder. Main area: empty placeholder for now (Phase 1 landing content goes in 01-02). Sidebar: header with logo "B", "Blueprint", placeholder "1 session left", Sign up; body "What are you building today?"; footer with chat input placeholder (textarea + RUN). Use primary #C27B66 from --primary-hex. Fonts: font-serif for headings, font-sans for UI. Match spacing, borders, shadows from designs.
  </action>
  <verify>Visit / — see Build shell with tabs, main area, sidebar. Research tab navigates to /research. Layout responsive (main ~65%, sidebar ~35%).</verify>
  <done>Build shell renders at / with correct layout and tab navigation. Design tokens available.</done>

- Navigate to / — Build shell visible, tabs work
- Navigate to /research — research landing visible
- Navigate to /research/explore/new — explore flow works
- Navigate to /research/dashboard — dashboard works
- No broken links from research to explore/dashboard
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- / serves Build shell (tabs, main, sidebar)
- /research serves research landing
- All research routes functional under /research
- Layout matches design reference (main 65%, sidebar 35%)
